In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a version 2.0 of an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on a topic of your choice using [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) or U.S. government open data released on the [data.gov](https://data.gov/) website. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.

+ **Project summary**: Eating in New York can be very enjoyable, but there are also potential health risks. With the huge number of restaurants in New York, supervising the restaurants became a tough task. 
Our shiny app is about the inspection results of restaurants in the five boroughs. The data comes from the Health Department.

Our target consumers are mainly the restaurant supervisors, who’s job duties are maintaining the overall quality control and ensure customer satisfaction. Using our app, they can explore different types of violations, where are they concentrated and what cuisines are highly potential to have certain violations, etc. According to this they can choose where they  are interested to work and help getting better.

Individuals like residents or travelers are also welcomed to use the app. They can get some references when choosing the next place to eat and enjoy.
